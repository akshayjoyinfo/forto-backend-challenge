Providing information to the customer increases transparency and reduces communication issues.

See shipments in pages of 20 elements per page
Search by shipment id
Sort by different fields (e.g. id, name) in ascending/descending order
View the shipment information on a separate shipment details page
Update the shipment name (should persist when the page is reloaded)
The interactions should not refresh the page.
